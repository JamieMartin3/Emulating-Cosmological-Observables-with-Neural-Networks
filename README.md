# Emulating-Cosmological-Observables-with-Neural-Networks

This project develops my Master's project to emualte more high quality cosmological observables.

This will contain a set of neural networks (MLP architecture) in JAX for rapid emulation of comsological observables. The observables that are emulated are:

- Linear matter power spectrum
- Nonlinear matter power spectrum
- Linear matter power spectrum (CB only)
- Nonlinear matter power spectrum (CB only)
- Cl_ee lensed spectrum
- Cl_ee unlensed spectrum
- Cl_tt lensed spectrum
- Cl_tt unlensed spectrum
- Cl_te lensed spectrum
- Cl_te unlensed spectrum
- Cl_bb lensed spectrum
- Cl_bb unlensed spectrum
- D_A(z)
- H(z)
- Derived paramteres:
    - simga8(z=0)
    - theta*
    - YHe
    - z_reio
    - z_star
    - r_star
    - z_drag
    - r_drag
